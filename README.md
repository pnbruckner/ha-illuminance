# Illuminance Sensor
Estimates outdoor illuminance based on either sun elevation or time of day. In either case, the value is adjusted based on current weather conditions.

## Modes of operation
Two modes are available: normal & simple. The desired mode is selected via the [configuration](#configuration-variables).

### Normal mode - Sun elevation
This mode uses an algorithm from the US Naval Observatory[^1] for estimating sun illuminance based on the sun's elevation (aka altitude.) The maximum value is about 150,000 lx. Below is an example of what that might look like over a three day period.

### Simple mode - Time of day
At night the value is 10 lx. From a little before sunrise to a little after the value is ramped up to whatever the current conditions indicate. The same happens around sunset, except the value is ramped down. The maximum value is 10,000 lx. Below is an example of what that might look like over a three day period.

## Supported weather sources
The following sources of weather data are supported:

* [Dark Sky Sensor (icon)](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.darksky/)
* [Dark Sky Weather](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/weather.darksky/)
* [Meteorologisk institutt (Met.no)](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/met/)
* [AccuWeather](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/accuweather/)
* [ecobee](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ecobee/)
* [OpenWeatherMap](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/openweathermap/)
* [Buienradar](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/buienradar/)

## Setup
Follow the installation instructions below.
Then add the desired configuration. Here is an example of a typical configuration:
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: illuminance
    entity_id: weather.home
```

## Installation
### Manual
Place a copy of:

[`__init__.py`](custom_components/illuminance/__init__.py) at `<config>/custom_components/illuminance/__init__.py`  
[`sensor.py`](custom_components/illuminance/sensor.py) at `<config>/custom_components/illuminance/sensor.py`  
[`manifest.json`](custom_components/illuminance/manifest.json) at `<config>/custom_components/illuminance/manifest.json`

where `<config>` is your Home Assistant configuration directory.

>__NOTE__: Do not download the file by using the link above directly. Rather, click on it, then on the page that comes up use the `Raw` button.

### With HACS
You can use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) to manage installation and updates by adding this repo as a [custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/) and then searching for and installing the "Illuminance" integration.

## Configuration variables
- **entity_id**: Entity ID of entity that indicates current weather conditions. See examples below.
- **mode** (*Optional*): Mode of operation. Choices are `normal` (default) which uses sun elevation, and `simple` which uses time of day.
- **name** (*Optional*): Name of the sensor. Default is `Illuminance`.
- **scan_interval** (*Optional*): Update interval. Minimum is 5 minutes. Default is 5 minutes.
- **fallback** (*Optional*): Illuminance divisor to use when weather data is not available. Must be in the range of 1 (sunny) through 10 (dark.) Default is 10.
## Examples
### Using Fallback Divisor
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: illuminance
    entity_id: weather.home
    fallback: 5
```
### Dark Sky Sensor
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: darksky
    api_key: !secret ds_api_key
    monitored_conditions:
      - icon
  - platform: illuminance
    entity_id: sensor.NAME
```
### Dark Sky Weather
```yaml
weather:
  - platform: darksky
    api_key: !secret ds_api_key
sensor:
  - platform: illuminance
    entity_id: weather.NAME
```
### Other Sensor Entities
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: illuminance
    entity_id: sensor.NAME
```
### Other Weather Entities
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: illuminance
    entity_id: weather.NAME
```
